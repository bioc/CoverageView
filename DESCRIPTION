Description: This package provides a framework for the visualization of
        genome coverage profiles. It can be used for ChIP-seq
        experiments, but it can be also used for genome-wide nucleosome
        positioning experiments or other experiment types where it is
        important to have a framework in order to inspect how the
        coverage distributed across the genome
